      The Department of Computer Science was established in the year 2009.
      Initially the department offered Integrated Master of Science in Computer
      Applications and IT. The department started three new programs M.Sc. (IT),
      MCA and PGDCA in the year 2011. It has consistently fulfilled its role of
      producing Computer Engineers ready to satisfy the needs of the IT world.
      It has a well qualified and experienced faculty team. The department has
      adequate facilities to support these teaching activities. As computers
      become obsolete fast, it is necessary to continuously upgrade the
      facilities. Students of the department have sufficient high end computing
      facilities.
